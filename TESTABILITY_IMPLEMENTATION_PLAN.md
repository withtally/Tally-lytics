## üî¨ **Testing Strategy**

### **Test Categories**

#### **Unit Tests** (70% of tests)
- Business logic in services
- Utility functions
- Data transformations
- Validation logic

#### **Integration Tests** (20% of tests)
- Database operations
- API endpoints
- Service interactions
- External API mocking

#### **End-to-End Tests** (10% of tests)
- Complete workflows
- Error handling paths
- Performance scenarios

### **Test Data Management**

#### **Factories Pattern**
```typescript
// __tests__/factories/postFactory.ts
export const createPost = (overrides?: Partial<Post>): Post => ({
  id: faker.string.uuid(),
  title: faker.lorem.sentence(),
  content: faker.lorem.paragraphs(),
  forum_name: 'arbitrum',
  created_at: new Date(),
  ...overrides,
});
```

#### **Test Database Strategy**
- Use PostgreSQL with pgvector in test mode
- Each test gets a fresh transaction
- Rollback after each test
- Seed data using factories

### **Mock Strategy**

#### **External APIs**
- Mock OpenAI completely
- Mock forum APIs with realistic responses
- Mock rate limiting behavior
- Mock error scenarios

#### **Database**
- Use real database for integration tests
- Mock repositories for unit tests
- Test both success and failure paths
